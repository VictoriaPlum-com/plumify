# Plumify â€” VictoriaPlum.com front-end test.

## Brief

Create a music search app based on Deezer using their free developer API.  

## Setup

* Fork the git repository at https://github.com/VictoriaPlum-com/plumify.git to your own GitHub account.
* Sign up for a free account with Rapid API using your GitHub sign-in at https://rapidapi.com/
* Go to https://rapidapi.com/deezerdevs/api/deezer-1 and copy the header parameters for 
`X-RapidAPI-Host` and `X-RapidAPI-Key` from the header parameters section. 
* Paste these into the `.env` file in the repository.

**Example**

```
API_HOST={X-RapidAPI-Host} // use your own host value
API_KEY={X-RapidAPI-Key} // use your own api key
```

* Once you're finished, host your code on GitHub Pages 
(see https://pages.github.com/). 
You will need to follow the directions for 
`Project site > Start from scratch > Step 4 Repository settings`.

## Build

* Run `npm install` to fetch all of the dependencies.
* Run `npm run dev` to spin up the development server.

## Guidelines

Please use the search api provided in `src/api/` to fetch the query results. 

The api documentation can be found at 
https://developers.deezer.com/api/search

The query results should be filtered into artist, album and track, and then 
rendered out in the UI.  

The app should match the `plumify-mockup.png` and use the following UI 
colors: 

```
* Purple: #4a1639
* Light grey: #6e4561
* Dark grey: #333333
* Grey: #c2c2c2
* Green: #6bb347
```

## Requirements

**Must**

* Be fully responsive.
* Use a CSS preprocessor (SCSS or Post CSS), add an appropriate loader 
  to the webpack.config file which will output a separate CSS file to the `dist/` directory.
* Use either vanilla JavaScript or a framework such as Vue, React or Angular.  
* Use semantic HTML tags.

**Must not**

* Do not use a CSS framework such as Bootstrap, Tailwind or Bulma
* Do not use jQuery

## Bonus points

* CSS Animations/transitions.
* Use the JavaScript Notification API to show notification of track changes
 (include track details and the album art).
* Make the player controls work using one of the MP3 preview URLs 
 returned for track results. This could be using the `Web Audio API`, 
 `HTMLMediaElement` or `<audio>` HTML tag.
